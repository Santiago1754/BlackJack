About The Game
---
Ever since the 1700s, BlackJack has been one of the classic card games played by people throughout the world.
This project aims to bring the excitement of the game to everyone, without any financial risk. This game will allow players to create their own unique user accounts and play with and against others over an internet connection.
There are no real currency transactions, as users will be provided with generous amounts of in-game currency.

Instructions for Running in Eclipse
---
After creating a new Java project, place all files from the 'src' folder directly into the Eclispe project's 'src' folder.
Test files should not be added if JUnit is not included in the project.

> Note:
>
> As of currently, JUnit needs to be manually added to the project build path to successfully run tests.
